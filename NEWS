## pointillism 0.1.2 (2018-08-22)

### New functions

- `clusterID()`: S4 generic that returns the cell cluster identity mappings as a
  `factor` for all cells.
- `findMarkers()`: Utility function that wraps `diffExp()` to identify cluster-
  specific genes across all clusters.

### Minor changes

- Converted `runZinbwave()` to an S4 method that works on
  `SingleCellExperiment`. For `seurat` objects, coerce to `SingleCellExperiment`
  before calculating weights.
- `plotDot()` now uses default [ggplot2][] color scale, unless specified.
- `plotReducedDim()`, `plotMarker()`: `theme_paperwhite()` is no longer used by
  default. Removed `grid` and `aspectRatio` arguments to simplify [ggplot2][]
  code handling.


## pointillism 0.1.1 (2018-08-20)

### New functions

- Now exporting `runZinbwave()` and `hasZinbwave()`, which were previously
  internal functions called by `diffExp()`.

### Minor changes

- Improved internal handling of `assays()` for objects that have zinbwave
  calculations applied. Now it doesn't attempt to keep only the `counts` assay.


## pointillism 0.1.0 (2018-08-10)

- Initial release.
