## pointillism 0.3.0 (2019-04-16)

- Updated S4 methods to support [Seurat][] v3 release.
- Switched Travis CI configuration to use Docker image.



## pointillism 0.2.5 (2019-04-01)

### Major changes

- Migrated code to [Acid Genomics][].
- Made `runZinbwave` defunct. No longer recommending zinbwave calculations for
  droplet single-cell RNA-seq.
- ggplot2 themes `theme_paperwhite` and `theme_midnight` are now imported from
  minimalism package instead of basejump.
  


## pointillism 0.2.4 (2019-01-24)



## pointillism 0.2.3 (2019-01-08)



## pointillism 0.2.2 (2018-12-22)



## pointillism 0.2.1 (2018-12-01)



## pointillism 0.2.0 (2018-11-15)



## pointilism 0.1.3 (2018-08-26)

### Major changes

- `as(seurat, "SingleCellExperiment")` now returns `scaleData` in assays, along
  with `varGenes` in `metadata` and ensures that `colData` and `rowRanges`
  are sanitized into camel case using the `camel` function internally.

### Minor changes

- Removed `convertGenesToSymbols` support for `seurat` class. Coerce genes
  to symbols manually prior to `seurat` coercion from `SingleCellExperiment`.
- `clusterID`: improved consistency between `SingleCellExperiment` and
  `seurat` methods, which now both work on `colData`.
- Improved internal `fetchData` calls to use camel case for consistency.
- `plotFeature` now sanitizes the `features` argument into camel case
  internally, for more consistent matching.
- `plotReducedDim` now uses camel case formatting for axis labels.
- Removed unnecessary legacy `.minimalAxis` constructor.
- `metadata<-` assignment method now stashes directly into `object@misc` for
  `seurat` class.
- Updated example data script and resaved.



## pointillism 0.1.2 (2018-08-22)

### New functions

- `clusterID`: S4 generic that returns the cell cluster identity mappings as a
  `factor` for all cells.
- `findMarkers`: Utility function that wraps `diffExp` to identify cluster-
  specific genes across all clusters.

### Minor changes

- Converted `runZinbwave` to an S4 method that works on
  `SingleCellExperiment`. For `seurat` objects, coerce to `SingleCellExperiment`
  before calculating weights.
- `plotDot` now uses default [ggplot2][] color scale, unless specified.
- `plotReducedDim`, `plotMarker`: `theme_paperwhite` is no longer used by
  default. Removed `grid` and `aspectRatio` arguments to simplify [ggplot2][]
  code handling.



## pointillism 0.1.1 (2018-08-20)

### New functions

- Now exporting `runZinbwave` and `hasZinbwave`, which were previously internal
  functions called by `diffExp`.

### Minor changes

- Improved internal handling of `assays` for objects that have zinbwave
  calculations applied. Now it doesn't attempt to keep only the `counts` assay.



## pointillism 0.1.0 (2018-08-10)

- Initial release.
