## pointillism 0.1.1 (2018-08-20)

### New functions

- Now exporting `runZinbwave()` and `hasZinbwave()`, which were previously
  internal functions called by `diffExp()`.

### Minor changes

- Improved internal handling of `assays()` for objects that have zinbwave
  calculations applied. Now it doesn't attempt to keep only the `counts` assay.


## pointillism 0.1.0 (2018-08-10)
