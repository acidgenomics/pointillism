[R][] package for for single-cell RNA-seq clustering analysis.

## Installation

This is an [R][] package.

### [Bioconductor][]

We recommend installing the package with [BiocManager][].

```r
if (!require("BiocManager")) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("remotes")
BiocManager::install("steinbaugh/pointillism")
```

For [R][] < 3.5, [BiocManager][] is not supported. Use `BiocInstaller::biocLite()` instead of `BiocManager::install()`. This requires sourcing the legacy [Bioconductor][] `biocLite.R` script.

```r
# try http:// if https:// URLs are not supported
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
```

## Markers

Shared [cell-cycle markers][] and [cell-type markers][] are available on [Google Sheets][]. Contact [Michael Steinbaugh][] if you'd like to contribute to this list, and he'll enable write access.

## Troubleshooting

### Maximal number of DLLs reached

```
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'bcbioSingleCell' in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...):
  maximal number of DLLs reached...
```

Depending on your operating system, you may encounter this error about hitting the DLL limit in [R][]. This issue is becoming more common as RNA-seq analysis packages grow increasingly complex. Luckily, we can configure [R][] to increase the DLL limit. Append this line to your `~/.Renviron` file:

```
R_MAX_NUM_DLLS=150
```

For more information on this issue, consult `help("dyn.load")` in the [R][] documentation. The number of loaded DLLs in an [R][] session can be obtained with `getLoadedDLLs()`.
