\usage{
\S4method{show}{CellCycleMarkers}(object)

\S4method{show}{CellTypeMarkers}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Any R object}
}
\description{
Display the object, by printing, plotting or whatever suits its
  class.  This function exists to be specialized by methods.  The
  default method calls \code{\link{showDefault}}.

  Formal methods for \code{show} will
  usually be invoked for automatic printing (see the details).
}
\details{
Objects from an S4 class (a class defined by a call to
  \code{\link{setClass}}) will be displayed automatically is if by a
  call to \code{show}.  S4 objects that occur as attributes of S3
objects will also be displayed in this form; conversely, S3 objects
encountered as slots in S4 objects will be printed using the S3
convention, as if by a call to \code{\link{print}}.

Methods defined for \code{show} will only be inherited  by simple
inheritance, since otherwise the method would not receive the
complete, original object, with misleading results.  See the
\code{simpleInheritanceOnly} argument to \code{\link{setGeneric}} and
the discussion in \code{\link{setIs}} for the general concept.
